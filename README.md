# Bookstore App | ITU BLG411E - Software Engineering 
This project is being developed for Istanbul Technical University BLG411E course. The aim of the project is to develop a bookstore app for mobile.

## Quick Start
To able to start the application, you need to run frontend and backend servers. To run servers, ensure node and npm are installed on your computer.

To check node installed: `$ node --version`

Node version should be "v16" or higher.

To check npm installed: `$ npm -v`

Npm version should be "8.\*.\*" or higher.

If you don't have node and npm, you can check: https://nodejs.org/en/

If you are ready to go, you can install dependencies: `$ npm install`

To run servers with development mode: `$ npm run dev`

Both backend and frontend servers should be starting to run. The backend server uses port 4000 and the frontend server uses port 3000.
